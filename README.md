## Description

This webpage was created as part of a UT Full Stack Flex Coding Bootcamp challenge. I modified starter code to create a simple calendar application for scheduling your work day.

## Usage

View current weekday and date when opening the webpage.

View and add events in time blocks for standard business hours (9am-5pm).

Time blocks are color coded to indicate past (grey), present (green), and future (blue).

Click on a time block to enter event details. Click the save button to save event text to local storage. Text will remain when page is refreshed.
