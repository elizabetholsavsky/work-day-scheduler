## Description

This webpage was created as part of a UT Full Stack Flex Coding Bootcamp challenge. I modified starter code to create a simple calendar application for scheduling your work day.

## Usage

View current weekday and date when opening the webpage.

View and add events in time blocks for standard business hours (9am-5pm).

Easily decipher past (grey), present (green), and future (blue) events with color coded time blocks.

Click on a time block to enter event details. Click the save button to save event text to local storage. (Text will remain when page is refreshed.)
